I recommend that you study linux command line and bash scripting first.  Then Network Plus, and then finish with Storage Plus.  After all that you can skim through san for dummies.  Honestly though, Storage Plus was better than SAN for dummies for me.

Once you have a good base of what a SAN is, you should dig into the the Pure Storage Videos on Youtube or the White papers.   Here is what I would look through.  How does an SSD work?  How is data written or deleted on an SSD?  How does space reclamation or gkidna, he's busy onarbage collection work?  What is latency?  How would you trouble shoot latency a customer was asking about?  

You don’t need to give specifics really, it’s more of a process, what to look for.  What was the activity before the latency spike, what was the activity during the spike, what was the activity/behavior after the spike?  Look for what could have caused it.  

Understand what an IOP is, how bandwidth and IOPs could affect each other.

Fibre Channel

FC (Fibre Channel) --- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibre_Channel
high speed network technology

Fibre Channel Layers
Layer 4 --- Protocol Mapping FC4
Lun Masking
Layer 3 --- Common Services FC3
Layer 2 --- Network FC2
Fibre Channel fabric
Fibre Channel zoning
Layer 1 --- Data Link FC1
Layer 0 --- Physical FC0

Layers FC0, FC1, and FC2 are known as FC-PH the physical layers of the fibre channel

FCP
Fibre Channel Protocol -- transport protocol that predominantly transports SCSI commands over Fibre Channel networks.

HBA
Host Bus Adapter (Host controller) --- Fibre Channel bus or SCSI bus --- adapter that connects the host to the network and other devices.  Each HBA has a unique World Wide Name (WWN)

WWN --- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Name
World Wide Name --- unique identifier used to identify switch, ports, etc.  Also known by WWID


WWNN
the node on the WWN -- in the FC


WWPN
the port on the WWN -- in the FC


CNA -- Converged Network Adapter
one device able to replace much of the FC infrastructure


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibre_Channel#Fibre_Channel_topologies

FC-P2P
Fibre channel -- point to point --- two devices connected directly to each other

FC-AL
Fibre channel --- Arbitrated loop --- all devices are in a loop or ring, similar to a token ring in networking.  adding or removing a device from the loop causes all activity on the loop to be interrupted.  The failure of one device causes a break in the ring.  Fibre channel hubs exist to connect multiple devices together and may bypass failed ports


FC-SW
Fibre channel -- switched --- all devices or loops of devices are connected to fibre channel switches.

FCoE --- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibre_Channel_over_Ethernet
Used to converge SAN and LAN together
Fibre Channel over Ethernet --- encapsulates fibre channel frames over ethernet networks.  
Must use at least a 10 GB ethernet framework   
Reduces cables, switches, NICs and HBAs, power, and additional costs
Works well for virtualization solutions
Requires:
Encapsulate the native FC frames
Ensure no frame loss in ethernet
Mapping between N-port IDs and MAC addresses (FC to Ethernet)
10 GB Ethernet
Remember --- FCoE is not routable at IP layer

FCoE Nic
Computers can connect to FCoE with converged network adapters (CNAs) which contain both Fibre Channel host bus adapter (HBA) and Ethernet Network Interface Card (NIC) functionality to the same card.


FCIP --- Fiber Channel over IP
SAN connect to FCIP Gateway at edge to connect to IP --- merges the fabrics

iFCP --- internet Fibre Channel Protocol
Gateway to Gateway protocol --- does not merge fabrics


SCSI and iSCSI

SCSI --- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCSI
Small Computer System Interface --- set of standards for physically connecting and transferring data between computers and devices


iSCSI --- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISCSI
Internet Small Computer System Interface --- using SCSI commands and protocols over IP networks  ---  SCSI commands encapsulated over TCP/IP


iSCSI Protocol Stack
Application
SCSI
iSCSI
TCP/IP
Physical

LUNS --- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_unit_number
Logical unit number --- number used to identify a logical unit addressed by the SCSI protocol or  SAN protocols which encapsulate SCSI, like FC and iSCSI

iSNS
	Name Reg and Storage Resource Discovery
	Discovery Domains and Login Control
	State Change Notification
	Bidirectional Mappings

Understand FC vs iSCSI vs FCoE

This article gives some pretty good basic information about the differences. http://www.infoworld.com/article/2627603/infrastructure-storage/fibre-channel-vs--iscsi--the-war-continues.html

RAID levels
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_RAID_levels
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_RAID_levels
Redundant Array of Independent Drives
	
	0 	- striping ( for performance )
	
	0+1 	- mirror of stripes (you have striped blocks being mirrored)
	
	1 	- mirrored ( for redundancy)
	
	1+0 	- stripe of mirrors (you have mirrored blocks being striped)
	
	5 	- block-level striping with distributed (rotating) parity, one whole “drive” (leg) can fail, and still have all data.
	
	6 	- block-level striping with double parity

RAID 5 vs RAID 4:
why was 4 abandoned
what is parity?
how does a RAID 5 handle losing a drive


SAN 
--- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage_area_network
	Storage Area Network ---
		Host layer
			HBA --- Host Bus Adapter
			GBIC --- Gigabit Interface Connector
			Fiber Optic Cables
		Fabric Layer
			Hubs
			Switches
			Gateway
			Router
		Storage Layer

NAS --- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage
	Network Attached Storage --- dedicated file system storage --- OS typically installed on NAS
		communicate over TCP/IP, and commonly HTTP
		Performance is limited
		Backup and recover operations need additional support and configuration

understand the differences of SAN vs NAS
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage#NAS_vs._SAN
(what makes them different internally, but also how they appear different from your PC)


why you would want one over the other.

SAN fabric (and know what a loop is, even though they aren't used anymore).

MLC --- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-level_cell
	Multi Level Cell SSD

encapsulation --- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_%28networking%29
	logical communication protocols

Metadata ---  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata
	Simple explanation, data about data

dedupe --- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_deduplication
	data deduplication --- data compression technique for eliminating duplication copies of repeating data.


compression --- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression
	data compression


thin provisioning --- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_provisioning
	using virtualization to give the appearance of having more physical resources than are actually available. In storage environment, provides a method for optimizing utilization of available story; relies on on-demand allocation of blocks of data versus the traditional method of allocating all the blocks up front.  Eliminates white space on the disk.

Multipathing --- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipath_I/O
fault-tolerance and performance-enhancement technique that defines more than one physical path 	between the cpu in a computer system and its mass-storage devices through buses, controllers, switches, 	and bridge devices connecting them.

IOPS --- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOPS
	Input/Output Operations Per Second --- performance measurement use to benchmark computer storage 	devices.

DCB
Data Center Bridging
set of standards for lossless ethernet
PFC (802.IQbb) -- CoS (class of service) scheme used to pause certain traffic on a link (Per Pri. Pause Frame)
ETS (802.IQaz) -- min guar. BW per classes
QCN (802.IQau) -- shape traffic that is causing congestion
DCBX -- disc. peers and exchange information

concept of zoning --- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibre_Channel_zoning
	partitioning of a fibre channel fabric into smaller subsets to restrict interference, add security, and to simplify management.

	Zoning applies only to switched fabric topology (FC-SW) it does not exist in simpler fibre channel topologies.



Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory


http://www.purestorage.com/blog/pure-mystery-series-part-1-pure-storage-mysteriesdemystifiednvram/

The Pure Storage FlashArray builds upon the common two-node controller model with one significant architectural difference. The NVRAM used to acknowledge writes with low latency and to enable services like adaptive data reduction is located in in the first two storage shelves and not in the storage controllers. By relocating NVRAM to the persistent storage layer (the Flash SSD), Pure Storage engineers have created a stateless storage controller architecture.

Latency --- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering)
http://storageswiss.com/2013/12/10/what-is-latency-and-how-is-it-different-from-iops/
latency is a measure of the time required for a sub-system or a component in that sub-system to process a single storage transaction or data request.


throughput --- http://www.thessdreview.com/featured/ssd-throughput-latency-iopsexplained/
Throughput is a measure of the amount of data that can be pushed through a common point in the data path in a given time.
Typically expressed as bits per second in networking terminology and as bytes per second in storage terminology.
